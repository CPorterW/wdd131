        <h2>AoM embodies our people.</h2>
        <p>Our religion is 200 years old, at least, if not 2000, if not since 
            that fateful pre-mortal counsel, if not since God pulled us out of 
            nothing into spiritual existence. Art of Manliness looks to old 
            traditions for inspiration about the type of men we should be.
            As men receive a cultural backlash for millenia of being more
            aggressive, socially dominating, and lustful, our fragile-egoed
            species definitely needs a reason to be proud of who we are.
            AoM shows that we are more than what our culture tells us. We can
            be honorable, gentle, and generous. 
        </p>
        <h2>Listen</h2>
        <p>I listen to AoM on spotify. The interviews are light-hearted and 
            interesting, perfect for my drive to work. I don't take any of 
            the advice as seriously as I could, but I learn some fun facts 
            as well as manly and virtuous ways of thinking.
