        <h2>A passionate, (almost) exciting explanation of American history.</h2>
        <p>Greg Jackson goes out of his way to give every historical figure a fair shake. 
            From George Washington to Theodore Roosevelt, Greg seeks to understand the 
            hearts behind our history. He also seeks to make it interesting. From exploding
            heads to pop culture references, his sense of humor makes history tolerable.
            The best part is how Greg pulls you into the mind and body of the people
            experiencing history's most dramatic moments.
        </p>
        <h2>HTDS embodies our people.</h2>
        <p>Understanding the hearts of others is nearly the definition of charity.
            Understanding our heritage is a favorite pastime of our people. Rewriting the
            lives of slandered and exalted figures to show who they really were is a 
            generous tribute.
            By combing through thousands of historical documents, Greg has been able to
            piece together the most inspiring moments of American history. He doesn't hold
            back though. He is very upfront about the sins of our fathers, but argues that
            we can't be fully responsible for conforming to an imperfect culture. He shows
            that men (and women) can be heroes. I've learned a lot about why civilizations 
            and people do what they do. I feel proud of my ancestors. There's no better way
            to understand humanity than by intimately examining countless life stories 
            through the eyes of someone who looks first at the heart.

        <p>I listen on spotify. The hour long episodes are irreverently scripted and professionally edited.
