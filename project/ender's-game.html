        <h2>A personification of empathy.</h2>
        <p>You're probably familiar with Ender's Game. You're probably not 
            familiar with the <a href="https://enderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Enderverse#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20series%20consists%20of,book%2C%20and%201%20audioplay%20adaptation.">"18 novels, 16 short stories, 2 short story 
            anthologies, 1 collection of essays, 13 comic series and one-shots, 
            1 manga, 1 film, 1 reference book, and 1 audioplay adaptation"</a> just
            from Ender's universe. Personally, I've only read most of Ender's books, 
            as well as "Saints" by Orson Scott Card (not to be confused with "Saints").
            Ender is deliberately written as the most empathetic living person, 
            which makes his books into schools of virtue. His characters think in ways 
            I've never thought before, silently soliloquizing brief essays on the most 
            beautiful and fascinating topics. Don't fear boredom, though, my first read-through
            of Ender's Game was an all-nighter on a cot in a tiny unfinished house my dad
            was renting during my parent's divorce. Despite repeated admonitions, I 
            found sources of light to read by so I could learn what Ender did
            about the buggers. I read it twice that week. I was thirteen.

        <h2>Ender embodies our people.</h2>
        <p>Ender is strong, defiant and undefeatable. Ender knows how to better his 
            friends, and loves them unconditionally. He never loses hope, he never
            fails to save his people or find a purpose. Get over the strange ideas 
            and look to the root of the message to see a defense of our faith.
            For instance, during the Shadow of the Hegemon, an atheist travels 
            with a nun, who makes some of the best arguments for Christianity
            in literary fiction. Then, he meets a member of our church, who teaches
            him that family is the greatest purpose. Then a gay scientist explains
            why he's marrying a woman and raising her children. Ultimately, Bean
            decides that marrying the woman he loves and having children with her 
            is worth the risk that his damaged genes pose. Astonishingly, none of 
            this feels forced. In fact, it is so subtle that my brother read it 
            and thought the atheism of Bean was a repudiation of our religion.

        <h2>Listen</h2>
        <p>I listen on Libby for free. The audiobooks are acted out pretty well.
            Most of the books are definitely for adults. Although OSC respects sex
            precisely as we ought to, he discusses it.
