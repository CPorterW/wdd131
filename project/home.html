        <h2>I believe in our <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/53cordon?lang=eng#title2">culture</a></h2>
        <p>I have met many members and ex-members that hate the 'culture of the church'. 
            I was once one of them. The most common critique is based on a 
            tendency towards perfectionism, but perfectionism is <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill?lang=eng#p5:~:text=It%20is%20often,therefore%20perfect.%E2%80%9D1">against our 
            doctrine,</a> and although I once blamed the church for my parent's strictness,
            I've discovered that most of our people are merciful and forgiving. 
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks?lang=eng#:~:text=From%20modern%20revelation,all%20understanding.%E2%80%9D2">Our church and our Christ certainly are.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Jack N. Gerard of the Seventy rejected condemnation of our culture when he said,</p>
        <figure><p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/17gerard?lang=eng#p11">"The worldly pull can be as direct as to destroy fidelity in marriage or as subtle as posting anonymous comments critical of Church doctrine or culture."</a></p></figure>
        <h2>I believe in solidarity</h2>
        <p>Our enemies are unified and vocal. Why aren't we? Why is atheism and
            infidelity vogue? Why aren't we as passionate about our faith as they are
            about carnality? Our prophet is God's mouthpiece at times, and at others
            he is the man God thought wise enough to guide us. We should promote the
            policies of the church, whether or not we agreed with the position before
            the church joined it. When <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-message-covid-19-august-2021#churchofjesuschrist">President Nelson recommended the Covid
            vaccine,</a> did you set aside your pride and follow his counsel? When <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland/the-second-half-second-century-brigham-young-university/">Jeffrey 
            R Holland reminded us to defend the family with metaphorical muskets,</a> did
            you return fire? Do you accept that <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng#p41:~:text=61%20And%20again,no%20one%20else.">polygamy was once the law of God?</a> 
            Our faith is the source of our unity, but only if we are willing to
            consecrate our hearts to God and His church. I believe that cultural
            pride is an aid to our solidarity, and so have collected some podcasts
            and books that secularly promote the spirit of the law.

        <h2>Holy-ish</h2>
        <p>What I'm about to show you is not squeaky clean. These might be temple
            recommend holders, but they don't bother bleeping out the stories they
            tell or the jokes they make. They do, however, show some reverence for 
            sex, and advocate for the family.
