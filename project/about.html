        <h2>My idea of an open-ended school project</h2>
        <p>I made this for a web development final as a sophomore at BYUI. 
            The assignment was to create a website that is interesting
            or useful, so naturally I created something that is interesting
            to me, but probably not interesting to anyone else. 
        </p>
        <h2>Porter Williams</h2>
        <p>That's my name! No, I'm not named after a short, squeaky,
            bad-A gunslinging bodyguard in our history, but I am named 
            after my patriarch grandfather and great-grandfather, 
            which in my estimation, is just as cool. I am married to the
            illustrious Danielle Williams who is pregnant with the equally
            illustrious Hudson C Williams. I am a software engineer-in-training 
            living in sunny Arizona. I believe that we are
            made to be happy, that we will be happy, and that worshipping
            God is our quickest path to supreme happiness. 
        </p>
        <h2>A disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing I or any of the writers I've linked are official 
            spokespeople of the church, except for the links to the 
            official church website. I should also mention that polygamy 
            is strictly forbidden by a prophet of God and that practicing
            polygamy or teaching others to do so is grounds for 
            immediate excommunication. I empathize with those who haven't
            accepted every church policy. The friction between  
            doctrines and the cultures that surround us can be like 
            sandpaper on the heart. Fortunately, God is merciful, and 
            I believe He forgives us for yielding to external cultures sometimes.
